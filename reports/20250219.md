## Contributions of Individual Team Members

### 1. Goals from Last Week

#### Raed:
- Improve cat breed classifier accuracy and enhance cat age classification data collection.

#### Troy:
- Switch backbones for dog model and retrain to achieve accuracy over 90%.

#### Christian:
- Continue refining AI codebase and fix minor UI bugs.

#### Stephen:
- Add more detail and information to the home page.

#### Nathaniel:
- Finish About Us page and test site functionality.

#### Sam:
- Implement model selection buttons and finalize UI design.

#### Zane:
- Develop dog profiles and add PDF export functionality.

### 2. Progress and Issues

#### Raed:
- **What I did:** Read machine learning papers that aims to solve the same problem as our application. I also began to do data scrapping using the bing API for cat life stages. 
- **What worked well:** Configuring the bing API was notably easy due to how students have free credits with Microsoft Azure. This made Bing API more accessible to me since API requests can build up large costs.  
- **What I learned:** I learned how to navigate and configure Microsoft Azure for data scraping.
- **Challenges:** Data scraping is often time consuming as I have to verify each image to ensure that the data I am using is reliable

#### Troy:
- **What I did:** Connected Dog Breed ONNX model to frontend. Created Dog Profiles. Stuck with ResNet50 due to inaccuracies by EfficientNetV2.
- **What worked well:** Integration of model, profiles, and API calls.
- **What I learned:** File separation and React coding. 
- **Challenges:** Connecting the breed connection with the dog profiles. 

#### Christian:

#### Nathaniel:
- **What I did:** Finished About Us page layout and design, just waiting on images and info from some members. Tested some of the websites functionality.
- **What worked well:** UI and testing both went pretty well.
- **What I learned:** I learned a bit more about Tailwind CSS
- **Challenges:** Some of test results were not super accurate. 


#### Sam:
- **What I did: I implemented some of the UI designs to the website while also finishing the actual UI wireframe
- **What worked well:** Changing the colors, adding borders, and moving stuff around the screen went well.
- **What I learned:** I learned more about typescript
- **Challenges:** Getting the UI to mesh with what we currently have on the screen was a little tricky to figure out.


#### Zane:
- **What I did:**
- **What worked well:** 
- **What I learned:** 
- **Challenges:** 

### 3. Plans and Goals for Next Week

#### Raed:
- Deploy a life stages model and redeploy a cat breed model with higher accuracy. 

#### Troy:
- Implement dog lifestage model to frontend. Update Dog PDF/Profile to have age bracket. 

#### Christian:
- 

#### Stephen:
- 

#### Nathaniel:
- Work on the instructions page, adding tips on photo taking for better results. Also look into creating more tests.

#### Sam:
- Finish making the UI look like the wireframe. Make sure all of the UI changes work with the front end. 

#### Zane:
