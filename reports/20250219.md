## Contributions of Individual Team Members

### 1. Goals from Last Week

#### Raed:
- Improve cat breed classifier accuracy and enhance cat age classification data collection.

#### Troy:
- Switch backbones for dog model and retrain to achieve accuracy over 90%.

#### Christian:
- Continue refining AI codebase and fix minor UI bugs.

#### Stephen:
- Add more detail and information to the home page.

#### Nathaniel:
- Finish About Us page and test site functionality.

#### Sam:
- Implement model selection buttons and finalize UI design.

#### Zane:
- Develop dog profiles and add PDF export functionality.

### 2. Progress and Issues

#### Raed:
- **What I did:** Read machine learning papers that aims to solve the same problem as our application. I also began to do data scrapping using the bing API for cat life stages. 
- **What worked well:** Configuring the bing API was notably easy due to how students have free credits with Microsoft Azure. This made Bing API more accessible to me since API requests can build up large costs.  
- **What I learned:** I learned how to navigate and configure Microsoft Azure for data scraping.
- **Challenges:** Data scraping is often time consuming as I have to verify each image to ensure that the data I am using is reliable

#### Troy:
- **What I did:** Connected Dog Breed ONNX model to frontend. Created Dog Profiles. Stuck with ResNet50 due to inaccuracies by EfficientNetV2.
- **What worked well:** Integration of model, profiles, and API calls.
- **What I learned:** File separation and React coding. 
- **Challenges:** Connecting the breed connection with the dog profiles.
