## Contributions of Individual Team Members

### 1. Goals from Last Week

#### Raed:
- Start working on the cat age classifier model.

#### Troy:
- Continue development of the dog age classifier model.

#### Christian:
- Develop the object detection model to identify dogs and cats in images.

#### Stephen:
- Integrate backend with the frontend image upload system.

#### Nathaniel:
- Work on refining the frontend layout and user experience.

#### Sam:
- Design user input fields for breed verification.

#### Zane:
- Ensure frontend responsiveness and refine UI.

### 2. Progress and Issues

#### Raed:
- **What I did:** I am currently scraping together data for cat ages. Admmittely, this is a lot more challenging than cat breeds, as data for this isn't as prevalent.

- **What worked well:** Upon improving my model's backbone I learned of more modern and efficient backbones that have less training time and higher accuracy. I will start implementing this new model next week.

- **What I learned:** I learned that developing a "smart" model isn't just about training data - it is also about how the layers are treated during training. Making a multi-layer inferencing network instead of retraining the last layer is something I hope to accomplish.
  
- **Challenges:** This is mostly due to hardware, but I the compute power needed to train an accurate model is immense. Even with a good GPU, my training times are very long. This makes development more difficult because fixing problems sometimes means I have to retrain my model.



#### Troy:
- **What I did:** Created ONXX files for dog age/breed for frontend and wrote scripts for classifiers in backend. 
Also wrote skeleton code for Dog and Cat API calls for more information about their breeds.
- **What worked well:** Exporting the pth files as onxx files. 
- **What I learned:** I should've drew a diagram of how the program flows so that I know where to put my files. 
- **Challenges:** Integrating ONXX files into frontend. Also wondering how to utilize API calls for more info about breed.

#### Christian:
- **What I did:** Added the instructions page to inform users how to use our website, and took care of various UI bugs throughout the program. Also assisted with development of object detection model to detect cats/dogs.
- **What worked well:** I was able to detect lots of useful next steps that were added to the Trello board and pushed out the Instructions page without any major roadblocks.
- **What I learned:** I learned a whole lot in general about the inner workings of AI models and further familiarized myself with the use of React, TailwindCSS, and other tools used throughout the project.
- **Challenges:** Continuing to gain familiarity with frameworks such as React, PyTorch that our group is using.

#### Stephen:
- **What I did:**  Worked on the home/landing page of the website, creating a basic design for it.
- **What worked well:**  I was able to create a design that looked good while incorporating color and style choices for the website.
- **What I learned:**  I learned more about using Tailwind to create a page.
- **Challenges:** Getting more familiar with using Tailwind as well as coming up with further design choices of the home page.

#### Nathaniel:
- **What I did:** Worked on the About page and oversaw Trello use, to make sure everyone was clear on what needs to be done.
- **What worked well:** Trello is now being used effectively, and the About Us page is in a decent state.
- **What I learned:** How to use React and Tailwind CSS to create a webpage.
- **Challenges:** Figuring out what more can be added to our site, and who's doing what.

#### Sam:
- **What I did:** I worked on designing the website. I looked into color pallets, website inspiration ideas, and creating a wireflow of the website. I also created a diagram of how the program works for our general page. I also spent some more time learning react/ typescript for the front end. 
- **What worked well:** I had no issues with any of my tasks this week.
- **What I learned:** I learned a lot about how to design a website and react/typescript. 
- **Challenges:** Getting a final UI design for the website.

#### Zane:
- **What I did:** I worked on the routing and overall framework of the website. I also made pet profiles for cats using "The Cats API" from APINinjas
- **What worked well:** Everything went well with this weeks projects. The cat profiles went surpisingly smooth, so did the routing, as I have a lot of experience with setting up React routing.
- **What I learned:** I learned a little bit more about API use, but a lot of the stuff I did this week was stuff I've done previously.
- **Challenges:** This week went pretty smooth, the only hiccup was with header design and it clipping over the sections below it.

### 3. Plans and Goals for Next Week

#### Raed:
- I hope to acheive 97% accuracy for my cat breed model. I also aim to do some data scraping for cat ages, specifically finding data 
  for stages of a cat's life. This includes: kitten, adult cat, senior cat. Although making an AI guess between 3 classes is likely   
  trivial, we might as well include features that may help the user. 


#### Troy:
- Integrate dog classifiers and dog/cat breed info APIs into front end. 

#### Christian:
- Begin to work on more of the AI codebase through hands-on experience, and fixing various minor bugs currently present in the app.

#### Stephen:
- Improving overall look of home/landing page and learning more about using React.

#### Nathaniel: 
- Adding images and small descriptions of each of us to the About Us page

#### Sam:
- Creating buttons that let the AI model know if it will be a cat or a dog. 
- Finalizing the design of the UI so we can implement it. 


#### Zane:
- Adding dog profiles
- Add a way to save profiles as pdfs or share them directly from the page.
- Fix page reload issue (returns 404 error when reloading non-home page, this is a common and easy to fix routing issue)
