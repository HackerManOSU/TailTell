# Weekly Status Report - 2025/01/15

## Team Report

### 1. Goals from Last Week
*(Leave this empty for the first week)*

- Create a repository for our project.
- Draft ideas for project ideas.
- Decide which tools we should use for a Full Stack Development.

### 2. Progress and Issues
- **What we did:**
  - Created a repository that will hold all work.
  - Selected "Tell Tails," an animal classifier that uses pretrained models to see if a given picture is a dog/cat, what their age is, and any health concerns.
- **What worked well:**
  - We communicated well, shared our thoughts on a Google Doc. 
- **What we learned:**
  - We need to do a weekly report every Wednesday.
  - We need to do a weekly meet with our TA.
- **Challenges:**
  - Finding a time where we are all available for a meet.
  - Assigning roles to who should be doing what.
- **Where we are stuck:**
  - Creating the features part for our project.

### 3. Plans and Goals for Next Week
- **High-level goals:**
  - Have an example model working to classify a cat's breed.
  - Discuss which tools we should be using for the framework of the model.
- **Tasks and responsibilities:**
  - Test various databases (Assigned to: Raed, Estimate: 7 days)
  - Research tools for model framework (Assigned to: Troy, Estimate: 7 days)
  - Set up a base frontend structure (Assigned to: Christian, Estimate: 7 days)
  - Develop and test initial backend APIs for file upload (Assigned to: Stephen, Estimate: 7 days)
  - Coordinate team meeting schedules (Assigned to: Nathaniel, Estimate: 7 days)
  - Draft features section for the project (Assigned to: Sam, Estimate: 7 days)
  - Create a basic Trello board for task management (Assigned to: Zane, Estimate: 7 days)
