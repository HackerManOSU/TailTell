# Weekly Status Report - 2025/01/22

## Team Report

### 1. Goals from Last Week

- Have an example model working to classify a cat's breed.
- Discuss which tools we should be using for the framework of the model.
- Test various databases and finalize the choice.

### 2. Progress and Issues
- **What we did:**
  - Set up a basic pretrained model using TensorFlow for testing.
  - Selected PostgreSQL as the database for the project.
  - Created a Trello board and assigned tasks.
  - Developed a basic frontend layout for image uploads.
- **What worked well:**
  - The team divided tasks effectively.
  - Trello made tracking tasks easier.
- **What we learned:**
  - Basic integration of TensorFlow models.
  - How to use database indexing to improve performance.
- **Challenges:**
  - Debugging file storage in the backend.
  - Deciding on the scope of features.
- **Where we are stuck:**
  - Improving model accuracy and finalizing features.

### 3. Plans and Goals for Next Week
- **High-level goals:**
  - Finalize the feature set.
  - Start integrating backend and frontend.
- **Tasks and responsibilities:**
  - Integrate the backend API with the frontend (Assigned to: Christian and Stephen, Estimate: 4 days).
