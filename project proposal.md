### Communication

## Product description 

Start with a short and catchy project title (not “CS 362 project pitch”) and your full names.

Abstract: The first paragraph of your document must be an abstract (or executive summary, or TL;DR) that explains your project at a high level. If someone read nothing but that one paragraph, what do you want them to know?

Goal: What are you trying to do? for example, what task or problem will your system help users with?

Current practice: How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

Novelty: What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be more successful than other approaches? Do not reinvent the wheel or reimplement something that already exists, unless your approach is different.

Effects: Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?

Technical approach: Briefly describe your proposed technical approach. This may include what system architecture, technologies, and tools you may use.

Risks: What is the single most serious challenge or risk you foresee with developing your project on time? How will you minimize or mitigate the risk? Don’t state generic risks that would be equally applicable to any project, like “we might run out of time”.
